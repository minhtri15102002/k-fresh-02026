# Test Fixing

Systematically identify and fix all failing tests using smart grouping strategies.

## When to Use
- Explicitly asks to fix tests ("fix these tests", "make tests pass")
- Reports test failures ("tests are failing", "test suite is broken")
- Completes implementation and wants tests passing
- Mentions CI/CD failures due to tests

## Systematic Approach

### 1. Initial Test Run

Run `make test` to identify all failing tests.

Analyze output for:
- Total number of failures
- Error types and patterns
- Affected modules/files

### 2. Smart Error Grouping

Group similar failures by:
- **Error type**: ImportError, AttributeError, AssertionError, etc.
- **Module/file**: Same file causing multiple test failures
- **Root cause**: Missing dependencies, API changes, refactoring impacts

Prioritize groups by:
- Number of affected tests (highest impact first)
- Dependency order (fix infrastructure before functionality)

### 3. Systematic Fixing Process

For each group (starting with highest impact):

1. **Identify root cause**
   - Read relevant code
   - Check recent changes with `git diff`
   - Understand the error pattern

2. **Implement fix**
   - Make minimal, focused changes
   - Follow project conventions

3. **Verify fix**
   - Run subset of tests for this group
   - Ensure group passes before moving on

4. **Move to next group**

### 4. Fix Order Strategy

**Infrastructure first:**
- Import errors
- Missing dependencies
- Configuration issues

**Then API changes:**
- Function signature changes
- Module reorganization
- Renamed variables/functions

**Finally, logic issues:**
- Assertion failures
- Business logic bugs
- Edge case handling

### 5. Final Verification

After all groups fixed:
- Run complete test suite
- Verify no regressions
- Check test coverage remains intact

## Best Practices

- Fix one group at a time
- Run focused tests after each fix
- Use `git diff` to understand recent changes
- Look for patterns in failures
- Don't move to next group until current passes
- Keep changes minimal and focused
