# Welcome to the ai-qa-training wiki

> **A production-grade QA automation playground that doubles as a training curriculum.**
> Real Playwright + TypeScript suite against an OpenCart e-commerce demo, a strict POM framework, a live multi-env QA Metrics dashboard, and a tightly-coupled library of AI prompts & Agent Skills — all wired together so a learner can read, run, extend, and ship tests on day one.

## What this repo gives you

Five things, working together — not five separate folders:

1. **A real test suite.** ~46 manual test cases mapped 1:1 to Playwright specs (UI · API · hybrid), runnable against **qa / uat / staging** environments out of the box.
2. **A strict framework.** Three-layer POM (`locators/` → `pages/` → `tests/`), `commonPage` discipline for actions, `assertHelper` + `Assertions` for verifications, web-first assertions, deterministic waits, test-tag guardrails.
3. **A live QA cockpit.** A self-contained dashboard rendering execution metrics (`run-summary.json`), defects pulled from GitHub Issues (`defects.json`), and requirements ↔ TC ↔ spec traceability — auto-deployed per environment on every push to `main`.
4. **An AI prompt + skill library.** ~25 curated prompts (`prompts/core` · `advanced` · `devops` · `reporting`) and 30+ Agent Skills (`.agents/skills/`) that already know this repo's conventions, so AI-generated code lands compliant on the first try.
5. **A 33-module training curriculum.** Six phases (Foundations → Toolkit → Playwright Core → Framework → API & Quality → Quality at Scale → AI-Assisted QA) under [`training/`](https://github.com/khanhdodang/ai-qa-training/tree/main/training), each module backed by code in this repo.

## How it all flows

```mermaid

    REQ["Requirements / User Stories"] --> MTC["Manual TCs<br/>documents/manual-testcases/"]
    MTC -->|prompts/core/test-generator| SPEC["Playwright specs<br/>tests/ui · tests/api"]

    DASH -->|deploy-pages job| PAGES["GitHub Pages<br/>per-env URLs"]
    DASH -.->|gaps & flakes| MTC
```

The right-to-left feedback loop is the point: dashboards surface gaps and flakes, which open issues, which drive new TCs, which generate new specs.

## Live reports (auto-deployed from `main`)

Every push to `main` runs the test matrix and publishes a per-env dashboard via [`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`](https://github.com/khanhdodang/ai-qa-training/blob/main/.github/workflows/playwright.yml):

| Environment | Dashboard | Allure | Playwright |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 **QA** *(canonical / site root)* | <https://khanhdodang.github.io/ai-qa-training/qa/> | [allure](https://khanhdodang.github.io/ai-qa-training/qa/allure/) | [playwright](https://khanhdodang.github.io/ai-qa-training/qa/playwright/) |
| 🟡 **UAT** | <https://khanhdodang.github.io/ai-qa-training/uat/> | [allure](https://khanhdodang.github.io/ai-qa-training/uat/allure/) | [playwright](https://khanhdodang.github.io/ai-qa-training/uat/playwright/) |
| 🔵 **Staging** | <https://khanhdodang.github.io/ai-qa-training/staging/> | [allure](https://khanhdodang.github.io/ai-qa-training/staging/allure/) | [playwright](https://khanhdodang.github.io/ai-qa-training/staging/playwright/) |

> Each dashboard has an **environment badge**, a **Run Context** card (env · base URL · build · timestamp), and an in-page **switcher** that hops between the three envs without losing your scroll or theme.

## Tooling & Conventions

- **TypeScript** in strict mode with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`, `noImplicitOverride`.
- **Path aliases:** `@pages/*`, `@locators/*`, `@utilities/*`, `@models/*`, `@data/*`, `@tests/*`.
- **Module resolution:** `bundler` (TS 6+ compatible, no deprecation warnings).
- **Page Object Model:** locators live in `locators/`, behavior in `pages/`, assertions in `tests/`. Never put a selector in a test file.
- **Naming:** kebab-case files, PascalCase classes, camelCase methods.
- **Imports:** absolute path aliases for cross-folder imports, relative for siblings.

See `documents/OOP_POM_Documentation.md` and `documents/automation-framework/` for the full framework spec.

## Git Hooks (Husky)

| Hook | Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pre-commit` | `npx lint-staged` | ESLint `--fix` on staged `*.{js,ts}`. |
| `commit-msg` | `commitlint` | Enforce Conventional Commits. |
| `pre-push` | `npm run check:all` + `.only` guard | Lint + typecheck, blocks pushes containing `.only` in `tests/`. |
| `post-merge` | post-merge automations | Refresh deps when `package-lock.json` changes. |

> **Tip:** if `pre-push` blocks you with `Detected '.only' left in the tests code!`, remove the `test.only(...)` / `describe.only(...)` and re-push. This guard exists to prevent half-suites from landing in CI.

Full guide: [`documents/husky-guidelines.md`](../documents/husky-guidelines.md).

## Reporting

### Playwright HTML

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

### Allure Report 3

Allure CLI is a devDependency — no global install required. Config lives in [`allurerc.mjs`](../allurerc.mjs).

```bash
# Static HTML in ./allure-report/
npm run allure-report

# Live server
npm run allure-serve
```

---

## Run-Result Notifications

After every `playwright test` run, [`reports/custom-reporter.ts`](../reports/custom-reporter.ts) builds a one-page summary (env, target, pass-rate, first failed tests, …) and **fans it out to every configured channel in parallel**.

| Channel | Required env vars | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Google Chat** | `GOOGLE_CHAT_WEBHOOK` | Plain-text body. Mute via `PLAYWRIGHT_DISABLE_GOOGLE_CHAT_REPORTER=1`. |
| **Slack** | `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Block Kit card with header + monospace body. |
| **Email** | `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_TO` (+ optional auth/ports) | SMTP via `nodemailer`, multipart text + HTML. |

Global controls:

- `NOTIFY_CHANNELS=googlechat,slack,email` — explicit allow-list.
- `PLAYWRIGHT_DISABLE_NOTIFICATIONS=1` — kill switch for CI.

A single failing channel does **not** affect the others — they're dispatched via `Promise.allSettled`.

---

## Knowledge Base

Domain documentation lives under [`knowledge-base/`](../knowledge-base/) and is the source of truth feeding the AI prompts:

- **UI:** `home`, `register`, `product`, `cart`, `checkout`, `wish-list`, `address-book`, `compare-products`, `profile`
- **API:** `cart`, `cart-ui-api`

When generating new tests with AI, point the agent at the relevant knowledge-base file first so it picks up the right selectors, payloads, and acceptance criteria.

---

## AI Prompt Library

Curated prompts under [`prompts/`](../prompts/), organised by lifecycle stage:

| Category | Prompts |
| --- | --- |
| **Core** | `pom-generator`, `test-generator`, `test-data-generator`, `failure-analyzer` |
| **Advanced** | `risk-analysis`, `visual-ai`, `visual-regression-reviewer`, `selector-healing`, `performance-analyzer`, `release-readiness` |
| **DevOps** | `ci-optimizer`, `docker-runner`, `parallel-sharding` |
| **Reporting** | `executive-summary`, `quality-score`, `sprint-health-dashboard`, `trend-analysis`, `defect-insights`, `report-summarizer` |

Each prompt is self-contained Markdown — paste it into Cursor / Claude / ChatGPT and provide the requested inputs.

---

## Agent Skills

Reusable, progressive-disclosure skills under [`.agents/skills/`](../.agents/skills/) covering:

- E2E + API testing patterns (`e2e-testing`, `api-testing-mock`, `api-security-testing`, `api-fuzzer-generator`)
- Test generation (`generate-testcase`, `generate-manual-testcase`, `playwright-test-generator`)
- Test fixing & healing (`test-fixing`, `playwright-test-healer`)
- Evaluation (`llm-evaluation`, `agent-evaluation`, `advanced-evaluation`)
- Workflow (`git-pr-workflows-git-workflow`, `git-pushing`, `git-advanced-workflows`)
- Engineering quality (`typescript-expert`, `spec-to-code-compliance`, `data-quality-frameworks`)

Skills are loaded on demand by the agent — see each `SKILL.md` for trigger conditions and usage.

---

## Contributing

1. Branch from `main` using a descriptive name (e.g. `feat/checkout-discount-codes`).
2. Follow the POM structure — no selectors in tests, no assertions in pages.
3. Run `npm run check:all` locally; the `pre-push` hook will run it again.
4. Use **Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `test:`, `docs:`, …) — enforced by `commit-msg`.
5. Open a PR; CI runs the full Playwright matrix.
